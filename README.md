# Cable-connector-anomaly-detection
Development of an AI Vision Inspection System that will detect and classify different types of damage on SAS-type cable connectors, including scratches, dents,cracks, chips or other damage and physical deformities.Should classify cables as either "good" or "bad" based on the inspection results.

Project requirements is:  

•Development of an AI Vision Inspection System that will detect and classify different types of damage on SAS-type cable connectors, including scratches, dents, and physical deformities.   

•To Inspect the connector PCB for any visible damage or defects.  

•Inspect the connector casing for cracks, chips, or other damage  

•Detect the presence of labels on the cable and verify if they are correctly oriented  

•Should classify cables as either "good" or "bad" based on the inspection results.  

•Store inspection data to a remote server (backup) and or local PC for later analysis and quality control purposes.  

•An intuitive user interface for operators to monitor the inspection process and view inspection results.  

•Allow authorized users to configure and customize inspection parameters and criteria.
